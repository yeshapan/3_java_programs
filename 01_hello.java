//simple program to print hello world in java

class hello{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

//NOTE that the class containing main function should have same name as file name (hello in this case)
//this is because since execution of program starts with main, it helps compiler locate where main function is (and that class should be declared in public only
//if file name is different from the class containing main, error will occur
